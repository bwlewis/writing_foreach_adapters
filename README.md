# Writing adapters for R's foreach package

This repository includes guides, code examples, and notes on writing
adapters for R's foreach package: https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach

The foreach package defines an interface between R programs and back-end
systems that can, for example, evaluate code in parallel.

The adapters in these notes are very simple and basic. They are designed
to illustrate the foreach API by example and to provide a simple guide
to writing new adapters.

You can view raw R Markdown files in the repository, and also see example
HTML output of them at these links:
